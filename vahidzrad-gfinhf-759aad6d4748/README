Gradient-Damage
===============

A FEniCS Project-based code for simulating material failure.


Description
===========

gradient-gamage is an open-source code that provides finite element-based
implementation of gradient damage models, that are used for phase-field
simulation of brittle fracture phenomena
It is based on `FEniCS Project <http://fenicsproject.org>`_.

Getting started
===============

1. Install FEniCS by following the instructions at
   http://fenicsproject.org/download. We recommend using Docker to install
   FEniCS.

2. Then, clone this repository using the command::

        git clone https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/gradient-damage.git

3. Start a Docker container::

        cd gradient-damage
        source launch-container.sh

3. You should now have a shell inside a container with FEniCS installed. To
   ensure that the gradient damage module as well as the docker FEniCS environment are
   fully functional, you may first run several unit tests by invoking the following
   command::

        ./test_run.sh

   All the tests should pass and you should see the following message in the
   terminal::

        fenics@bcbb173f46e7:~/shared$ ./test_run.sh
        ============================= test session starts ==============================
        platform linux2 -- Python 2.7.12, pytest-2.8.7, py-1.4.31, pluggy-0.3.1
        rootdir: /home/fenics/shared, inifile:
        collected 1 items

        examples/traction/test_traction.py .

        ========================== 1 passed in 29.03 seconds ===========================

   If it is the case, congratulations! Please then feel free to try out an example::

        cd examples/nucleation
        python bar_basic.py

   The resulting fields are written to the directory ``bar-results/`` which
   will be shared with the host machine. These files can be opened using
   `Paraview <http://www.paraview.org/>`_.

Contributing
============

We are always looking for contributions and help. If you have ideas, nice applications
or code contributions then we would be happy to help you get them included. We ask you

Notes
=====

HDF5File stores the output in a special way allowing for loading of data into dolfin,
but not compatible with any viewer.

* To store data for viewing, use **.xdmf** format

* To store data for reloading, use **.HDF5** format

* To store data for viewing and reloading, use **.xdmf** and **.HDF5** format

We use **gmsh** for unstructured mesh generation. Make sure that **gmsh** is in your system **PATH**.

For **multi-material** , you could assign indicators for **subdomains** and **boundaries** directly in the  ``.geo`` file, for instance :

``Physical Line (%) = {%};``

``Physical Surface (%) = {%};``
